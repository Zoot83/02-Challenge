# 02-Challenge

This is the first challenge submittion of the course for UPENN. In this challenge we are insturcted to take current on the job code and modify it so that it functions correctly. We are not to change and of the design and styles in the code rather we are to change the functionality of the code. 

We are to follow standard coding practices and allow our code to be accessable to all.
